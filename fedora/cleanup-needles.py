"""Dumb script for staging an old needle cleanup.

First, log in to the stg server (always use stg because some needles may
only be used on Power) and do this:
    psql -h db-openqa01.iad2.fedoraproject.org -U openqastg -d openqa-stg -W
and enter the password (from /etc/openqa/database.ini). Now do this,
changing the date in the `select` command to an appropriate one - a few
months before the current date:
    \o oldneedles.txt
    select filename from needles where date_trunc('day', last_matched_time) < '2023-01-01' or last_matched_time is null;
    ctrl-d (to quit)
now copy oldneedles.txt off the server, and run this script on it. It will
stage a git commit that removes all the identified needles.
